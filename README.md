# hubot-moo-script

hubot-moo-script is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was
initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be
deployed on [Heroku][heroku] to get you up and running as quick as possible.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve

### Running hubot-moo-script Locally

You can test your hubot by running the following, however some plugins will not
behave as expected unless the [environment variables](#configuration) they rely
upon have been set.

You can start hubot-moo-script locally by running:

    % bin/hubot

You'll see some start up output and a prompt:

    [Sat Feb 28 2015 12:38:27 GMT+0000 (GMT)] INFO Using default redis on localhost:6379
    hubot-moo-script>

If you type moo, you'll see Super Cow Powers.

    hubot-moo-script> hubot-moo-script moo
             (__)
             (oo)
       /------\/
      / |    ||
     *  /\---/\
        ~~   ~~
    ...."Have you mooed today?"...
    hubot-moo-script> hubot-moo-script moo moo
             (__)
             (oo)
       /------\/
      / |    ||
     *  /\---/\
        ~~   ~~
    ...."Have you mooed today?"...
